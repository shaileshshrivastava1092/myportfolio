            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education
                system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under
                various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
                Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14.
                The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in
                Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined
                legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made
                education a ‘concurrent subject’. From this point on the central and state governments shared formal
                responsibility for funding and administration of education.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Digital India</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Digital India is a campaign launched by the Government of India in order
                to ensure the Government's services are made available to citizens electronically by improved online
                infrastructure and by increasing Internet connectivity or making the country digitally empowered in the
                field of technology.[1][2] The initiative includes plans to connect rural areas with high-speed internet
                networks. It consists of three core components: the development of secure and stable digital
                infrastructure, delivering government services digitally, and universal digital literacy.
                Launched on 1 July 2015, by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi, it is both enabler and
                beneficiary of other key Government of India schemes, such as BharatNet, Make in India, Startup India
                and Standup India, industrial corridors, Bharatmala, Sagarmala
                As of 31 December 2018, India had a population of 130 crore people (1.3 billion), 123 crore (1.23
                billion) Aadhaar digital biometric identity cards, 121 crore (1.21 billion) mobile phones, 44.6 crore
                (446 million) smartphones, 56 crore (560 million) internet users up from 481 million people (35% of the
                country's total population) in December 2017, and 51 per cent growth in e-commerce.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">Web development</p>
            <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the
                Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from
                developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses,
                and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly
                refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison,
                client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce
                development.

                Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web
                sites: writing markup and coding.[2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make
                content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

                For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web
                developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. Smaller
                organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to
                related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. Web development may
                be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There
                are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack
                developer. Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
                while back-end developers deal with the servers.</p>
